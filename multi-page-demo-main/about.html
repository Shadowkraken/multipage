    <h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1>
    <p>This is basic Knowlage Of minecraft which willl be explained</p>

    <h2>Starting Out</h2>
    <p>
      Minecraft is a sandbox "survial" building game with hundereds of different
      ways to play it. I put survival in quoutations because it's not technaclly
      only survival. minecraft has a feature called CREATIVE MODE. Which is a
      gamemode in which you have access to everything in the game including
      commands and special blocks that can only be given by the /give command.
      One of those blocks has to do with redstone contraptions
    </p>
    <h2>Redstone</h2>
    <p>
      Redstone is one of the most interesting things within minecraft because of
      the ways is works. Redstone is a way to make automatic machinery like
      automatic doors and mob farms and sometimes even automatic farms. some
      people find redstone to be one of the most annoying things in minecraft
      but others like my self really enjoy it.
    </p>
    <h2>Mobs/Monsters/Animals/NPCs</h2>
    <p>
      Mobs or monsters are an essential part of minecraft because they add forms
      on danger to the game there are 4 iconic mobs witin minecraft and those
      are: The Skeleton, The Zombie, The Spider, and The Creeper. the creeper is
      the MOST iconic mob in minecraft. sometimes these mobs cause have special
      rare varients like the spider jockey which is a skeleton riding a spider,
      or a baby zombie the most dangerous mob in minecraft, OR a charged creeper
      which is just a bit less dangerous than the baby zombie. all mobs are
      hostile or neutral which means they will attack on sight or will attack if
      prevoked. Now aminals on the other hand can range between neutral to
      passive which means they wont attack unless prevoked or they just wont
      attack at all. and NPCs which there are only 2 of The villager which can
      only be found in villages which are around the world and the wandering
      trader which has a small chance to spawn near the player. villagers and
      wandering traders and passive mobs which means that they wont attack at
      all but if you hit a villager near an iron golem which is a neutral mob
      the iron golem will go for the kill. and if your wondering which NPC is
      easier to find that would be the villager because if you seacher for maybe
      20 ish mins you can find a village with hundereds of villagers
    </p>
    <h2>Bosses</h2>
    <p>
      bosses in my opinion are some of the most annoying things in minecraft
      because each one is SO SPECIFIC like take the ender dragon, its a dragon
      that lives in the end and youd think "oh fighting this EnD DrAgOn will be
      super easy right?". IT ISNT because you have to kill enderman which are
      neutral mobs that have a 50 percent chance of dropping 1 ender pearl so
      you need to kill about 40 to be safe and still might only end up with 10
      then 6you have to go to the nether which is just a recreation of HELL to
      kill a thing called a blaze which is only found in one of the rarest
      structures in the game to kill them and get something called a blaze rod.
      but dont kill them over the HUNDEREDS OF LAVA POOLS OTHER WISE YOU MIGHT
      AS WELL JUST JUMP OF THE SIDE OF THE FORTRESS WITH IT BECAUSE YOUR NOT
      GETTING THAT ONE BACK. But it only gets worse because after getting all
      the nessecary materials for 16 eyes of ender you have to follow them for
      hundereds of blocks to find the rarest structure in the game THE
      STRONGHOLD only to hope you atill have atleast 12 eyes of ender cause if
      not then your screwed. ONLY THEN TO HAVE TO FIGHT THE ENDER DRAGON ONLY TO
      GET AN EGG.... YEAH AN EGG so not worth it. but dont worry because theres
      still 2 other bosses you can fight that are more annoying than the last
      because the wither will inflict you with WITHER DAMAGE which slowly lowers
      your health until uh oh your dead and all you get from the wither is a
      star which is used for a freakin night light A.K.A A BEACON which requires
      at least 9 block of iron, diamond, gold, emerald, or netherite to even
      work. or the warden a 9 foot all giant thing of mold which roams an
      aincent city the 2nd rarest structure in the game and his whole thing is
      he hits like a god damn semi truck(side note when i say hits like a semi
      truck i mean he does a crap ton of damage). And someone you might be
      saying "BuT hEs BlInD hE cAnT sEe YoU" that dont matter he can sense
      vibrations and he can smell you so if you move without crouching or if you
      have food on you, mate your screwed. and even if you manage to kill him
      you get a block thats only purpose it to make your world moldy.
